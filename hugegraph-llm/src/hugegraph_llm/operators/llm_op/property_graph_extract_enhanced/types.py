    The parser guarantees only that:

    * ``vertices`` and ``edges`` are lists (possibly empty);
    * every element is a ``dict`` (non-dict candidates are dropped by the
      parser with an ``ITEM_NOT_OBJECT`` warning);
    * items with an explicit ``type`` field agree with the array they live in
      (mismatches are dropped with ``ITEM_TYPE_MISMATCH``).

    The dataclass is frozen so a consumer cannot rebind the ``vertices``/
    ``edges`` lists, but the lists themselves are ordinary mutable lists that
    downstream stages read but do not modify in place.

    (ready to emit) or carry ``PENDING_OUT_KEY`` / ``PENDING_IN_KEY`` hints
