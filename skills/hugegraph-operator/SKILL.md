name: hugegraph-operator
description: Route HugeGraph MCP operational checks to status, schema, permission, AI availability, and read-only verification tools. Use when the user asks to check the current graph, schema, MCP connection, readonly state, HugeGraph-AI state, counts, indexes, or readiness.

# HugeGraph Operator

## Tool Routes

| Goal | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Quick check connection, status, permissions, counts | `inspect_graph_tool(include_raw_schema=false)` |
| Inspect full schema, primary keys, indexes, edge endpoints | `inspect_graph_tool(include_raw_schema=true)` |
| Check readonly, allow_ai, graph, or graphspace | `inspect_graph_tool(include_raw_schema=false)` |
| Verify whether graph data exists | `execute_gremlin_read_tool(gremlin_query)` |
| Get schema context before query | `inspect_graph_tool(include_raw_schema=true)` |
| Check schema before import | `inspect_graph_tool(include_raw_schema=true)` |
| Check schema before schema design | `inspect_graph_tool(include_raw_schema=true)` |
| Check AI generation readiness | `inspect_graph_tool(include_raw_schema=false)`, then optionally `generate_gremlin_tool(query, execute=false)` |

## Order

```text
Status check: inspect_graph_tool
Schema audit: inspect_graph_tool(include_raw_schema=true)
Data verification: inspect_graph_tool -> execute_gremlin_read_tool
```
